* Promtail

### How to use it

The library must be included in the default-setup script. How to use the library:

1. Place deploy-functions.sh library in the `/usr/local/include/osshelp/` folder
1. Place default-setup script in the `/usr/local/osshelp/` folder with default-setup.local (if you need an additional customization)
1. Install yq and jq binaries
1. Add necessary profiles to container yaml config which is used by lxhelper
1. Deploy container with lxhelper and make sure that the default-setup works as you expected

In the examples directory you can find a template of default-setup.local and available profiles usage examples.

Thereâ€™re install/update scripts in the repository. Command for installation (deploy-function.sh, default-setup, yq and jq):

```shell
curl -s https://oss.help/scripts/backup/backup-functions/install.sh | bash
```

Or you can use this [Ansible role](https://github.com/OSSHelp/ansible-deploy-functions) to install it.

### Useful

As a library, deploy-functions is often used with [LXHelper](https://github.com/OSSHelp/lxhelper), but it's still possible to use it without LXHelper.

## FAQ

### Log

You can find log in `/var/log/default-setup.log`.

### Debug mode

If you want to run default-setup in debug mode, you need to:

* Export INSTANCE_ID variable in the container
* Run default-setup with `bash -x` command

Example:

```bash
export INSTANCE_ID=container_name
bash -x /usr/local/osshelp/default-setup server_name
```
